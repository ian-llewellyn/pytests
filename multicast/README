Herein lies a set of file all concerned with multicast network communication.

I wrote these to learn and examine the way that multicast operates.

A - one source for a group
In this implementeation, I'd like to demontrate a talking clock audio server.
Included will be an audio streaming client that will listen to traffic on a
configurable multicast group. The client should have the ability to use SSM
(source specific multicast) to block out any unwanted traffic on the multicast
group.

b - multiple sources for a group
This application will be a chat client that gives any participating user the
ability to broadcast text messages to any other client on the same group. This
application will therefore use ASM (any source multicast).
